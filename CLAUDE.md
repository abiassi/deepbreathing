# Deep Breathing Project

How we work on `deepbreathingexercises.com`. Read this before starting work; the system here exists so changes don't ship "half-haz" without baselines or measurement.

## Experiments — before you ship

**SEO changes** (titles, meta, sitemap, redirects, indexing): log in [`docs/SEO-EXPERIMENTS.md`](docs/SEO-EXPERIMENTS.md).

**Product/UX changes** (orb cue, hero placement, conversion timing, tracking events, anything measured by the funnel): log in [`docs/PRODUCT-EXPERIMENTS.md`](docs/PRODUCT-EXPERIMENTS.md).

For both, the rule is the same:

1. Add an entry with **hypothesis**, **baseline metrics**, and **pre-committed success criteria** (the "I'll call this Success if X moves by ≥Y%" line) BEFORE shipping — not after.
2. Link the commit, set a measure-after date, mark `🔄 Implemented`.
3. On the measure-after date: apply the criteria, don't relitigate. Move to ✅ Success / ❌ Failed / ⚪ Inconclusive / 🟡 Mixed.

The pre-commitment matters. Without it, every "implemented" entry drifts to "inconclusive" because we end up arguing about what counted.

## Current state — where the funnel is right now

[`docs/FUNNEL-DASHBOARD.md`](docs/FUNNEL-DASHBOARD.md) is the single source of truth for the current funnel (start → pause → complete → return → engaged minutes → signup). Refreshed every Friday — see [`docs/runbooks/weekly-funnel-refresh.md`](docs/runbooks/weekly-funnel-refresh.md). The recurring scheduled task `deepbreathing-weekly-funnel-refresh` (Fri 09:00 ET) prompts the next session to run the refresh.

When the question is "how is X doing?" — look at the dashboard first, not GA4 directly. The dashboard has the curated context.

## Tools and data sources

[`docs/runbooks/tools-and-data-sources.md`](docs/runbooks/tools-and-data-sources.md) is the per-task lookup for analytics, SEO, DB queries, deploy verification. **Read this BEFORE starting any analytics, SEO, or DB work.** It documents project identifiers (Vercel, GA4, Neon) and the gotchas already learned the hard way:

- GA4 lives on the **DKMT** account, property `527524722`, measurement ID `G-53DLCBMRL3`. The OLD `G-7GG9WVNBBP` (Abiassi) is stale.
- `mcp__gsc__search_analytics` returns **403** for this site — use `mcp__mass-translate-backend__get_search_performance` instead.
- The mass-translate **proxy strips one locale prefix** before forwarding to Next.js. Redirect rules in `next.config.js` must target the post-proxy URL.
- `dkmt-cc` creds **expire ~30 days** — `dkmt-cc login` to refresh, or fall back to `vercel env pull`.
- Cloudflare + Vercel cache may serve stale 404s for ~5 min after a redirect deploy. Always cache-bust with `?cb=$(date +%s%N)` when verifying.

If you discover a new gotcha or tool detail, **update tools-and-data-sources.md in the same commit** as your work. The system only works if it stays current.

## Backlog of things not yet shipped

[`docs/UX-BACKLOG.md`](docs/UX-BACKLOG.md). Once shipped, move the entry to `PRODUCT-EXPERIMENTS.md` with hypothesis + criteria.
