    "intro": "A physiological sigh is two quick inhales followed by a long, unforced exhale. The second inhale helps expand under‑ventilated lung regions; the long exhale slows breathing and can reduce arousal within minutes. Use as a brief on‑demand reset or a 2–5 minute practice."

      "heading": "What it is",
      "content": "The physiological sigh is a brief pattern: take a deep nasal inhale, add a small top‑up inhale without shrugging, then exhale slowly until comfortably empty. Sighs are a natural reflex that appear every few minutes to maintain healthy lung mechanics. Practicing them deliberately leverages that reflex: the extra sip of air re‑expands areas of the lungs, and the extended exhale promotes a calmer state. Keep breaths quiet and small‑to‑moderate—smoothness beats volume. If you feel edgy or light‑headed, make the breaths smaller or pause."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Benefits",
      "content": "Daily exhale‑focused cyclic sighing (≈5 minutes) improved mood and lowered respiratory rate more than mindfulness meditation in a randomized trial. A single short bout can help many people feel calmer; a pilot RCT in a clinic waiting room found a 4‑minute cyclic‑sighing audio reduced pain intensity and unpleasantness vs. control. Physiologically, sighs help prevent alveolar collapse and restore lung compliance—one reason they naturally increase under stress or hypoxia. Expect quick, modest relief; combine with good sleep, movement, and light exposure for larger gains."
    },
    {
      "heading": "When to use",
      "content": "Use 1–3 cycles during spikes of stress, before difficult conversations, after alarms, or mid‑flight turbulence. Run 2–5 minutes as a micro‑practice before bed or between work blocks. For performance or focus where you want calm‑alert—not drowsy—this pattern works well because exhales are long but the practice is brief."
    },
    {
      "heading": "When to skip",
      "content": "If you feel dizzy, tingly, or chest‑tight, stop and resume with smaller breaths. People with cardiopulmonary disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or syncope history should keep the effort gentle and practice seated. During pregnancy, avoid straining; use light breaths and skip prolonged breath‑holding (not required for this pattern). If strong air hunger or panic arises, pause and return later."

    {
      "question": "What evidence supports the physiological sigh?",
      "answer": "A month‑long randomized study comparing three breathwork protocols to mindfulness found breathwork improved mood and reduced respiratory rate more, with the exhale‑focused cyclic sighing showing the largest gains. A pilot RCT in an orthopedic clinic waiting room found a 4‑minute cyclic‑sighing audio reduced pain intensity and unpleasantness vs. a time‑matched control. Together these suggest quick, modest benefits for mood and acute symptoms with brief daily practice. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does a sigh help the lungs?",
      "answer": "Sighs are deeper‑than‑normal breaths that periodically reinflate under‑ventilated lung regions, which helps prevent alveolar collapse and restores lung compliance. Neurophysiology studies identify a dedicated brainstem circuit (RTN/pFRG → preBötzinger complex) that can trigger sighs—explaining how they arise and why they increase under stress or hypoxia. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}"
    },
    {
      "question": "How many repetitions and how often?",
      "answer": "For an in‑the‑moment reset, do 1–3 physiological sighs. For training effects, use 2–5 minutes of cyclic sighing most days. In the RCT, 5 minutes daily produced the clearest changes in mood and respiratory rate; a clinic pilot showed 4 minutes reduced pain. Start small and increase only if it stays comfortable. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it safe for everyone?",
      "answer": "It’s generally safe when done gently. Practice seated if you’re prone to dizziness. People who are pregnant or have cardiopulmonary disease or syncope history should avoid straining and keep breaths small. Any light‑headedness likely reflects over‑breathing—shrink the inhale and slow the exhale or stop and resume later. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the physiological sigh better than box breathing?",
      "answer": "They’re tools for different aims. The RCT found exhale‑focused cyclic sighing yielded the largest mood and respiration‑rate improvements vs. mindfulness, with box breathing also helpful. For rapid relief in a few breaths, many prefer sighing; for structured pacing or longer sessions, box breathing or coherent breathing may suit better. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}"
