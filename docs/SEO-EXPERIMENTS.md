## Active Experiments

### 2026-05-06: E-E-A-T Wellness-Class Overhaul — Founder Byline + Lineage + Light Citations

**Hypothesis:** The site is positioned as a wellness/breathwork product (NOT a YMYL/medical site), but currently signals authority like neither — anonymous "Resonance Editorial Team" byline, no lineage attribution, no inline citations, fallback "Resonance Editorial Review Team" rendering on every pattern page despite no real reviewer. Wellness-class peers (Calm, Othership, Wim Hof Method, Huberman, mindbodygreen) are uniformly person-led with lineage attribution and 1–3 inline peer-reviewed hyperlinks per page. Switching to a named founder byline ("Abi Abiassi"), adding 1–2 sentence lineage paragraphs to each technique page, fixing 9 documented overclaims, and applying ~47 light-touch citations across 22 pages should improve avg position on the technique + use-case cohort.

**Reference class & rationale:** [docs/research/eeat-citations-2026-05.md](research/eeat-citations-2026-05.md) — full audit, citation database, lineage paragraphs, decision log. Reference class is wellness/breathwork (NOT medical); we are deliberately NOT adding `MedicalWebPage` schema, "medically reviewed by" lines, or numbered DOI footnotes.

**Baseline (May 6, 2026, last 28d Google):** From MEMORY.md — Mar 2026 baseline: 445 clicks, 111k impressions, avg pos 11.5 (recovered from 19.7 in Feb). **Pull a fresh GSC export of the 22-page cohort (12 `/breathe/*` + 10 `/for/*`) on the day of merge and pin avg position per page here.** Bing baseline: 140 clicks, 4,236 imp, 3.3% CTR, avg pos 4.8.

**What's shipping:**
1. Byline rename: "Resonance Editorial Team" → "Abi Abiassi" across `breathing-pages.ts` (12), `use-case-pages.ts` (18), and 6 pSEO Article schemas (Organization → Person)
2. `DEFAULT_REVIEWER` fallback dropped — visible "Reviewed by Resonance Editorial Review Team" line removed when reviewer is empty
3. Twitter creator handle: `@deepbreathing` → `@abiassi_`
4. Dead code: `src/components/seo/content-credentials.tsx` deleted
5. (next commit) `lineage` field + 12 lineage paragraphs on technique pages
6. (next commit) 9 honesty corrections on existing copy + 3 unsourced number fixes (`/for/focus`, `/for/lung-capacity`)
7. (next commit) `/about/abi` page (founder bio + Person schema with `sameAs`: linkedin/abiassi.com/x)
8. (next commit) `/about/methodology` → `/about/editorial-policy` rename + 301 redirect
9. (next commit) Inline `[text](url)` citation rendering + ~47 light-touch peer-reviewed hyperlinks (Calm/Othership density, NOT footnotes)
10. (post-deploy) `mcp__mass-translate-backend__translate_content` for es/pt/fr/de/ja → `deploy_translations` → submit sitemaps

**Pre-committed success criteria (8 weeks from merge):**
- ✅ **Success**: Avg Google position across the 22-page cohort improves by ≥2 points
- 🟡 **Mixed**: Improvement on ≥half the cohort but cohort avg moves &lt;2 points
- ⚪ **Inconclusive**: Cohort avg moves &lt;1 point (within noise)
- ❌ **Failed**: Cohort avg position degrades

**Measure-after date:** 2026-07-01 (8 weeks).

**What's deliberately NOT in this experiment** (to keep signal clean):
- New page creation for new keyword targets
- Backlink work
- Translation re-submission (will run, but not the metric being tested)
- App store listing changes

### 2026-05-05: Bing Translated-Page Indexing Push — URL + Content Submission

**Hypothesis:** Of 47 FR URLs in the sitemap, only 1 (`/fr/breathing-visualizer`) has any Bing data over the last 28 days. Same shape for ES/PT/DE/JA. Bing has been crawling locale sub-sitemaps for weeks (`Status: Success` on all 5), so the bottleneck isn't sitemap awareness or crawl access. `GetUrlInfo` shows FR pages were discovered Mar 13 but mostly haven't been recrawled since. Pushing every translated URL via Bing Webmaster's URL Submission API (and full HTML via Content Submission for the top 10 per locale) is the strongest direct signal we can send. If submission/crawl-budget was the bottleneck, we'll see translated URLs appear in Bing performance data within 2–4 weeks. If nothing changes, it confirms **external authority** (DR 0.2, zero external backlinks pointing to translated variants — `AnchorCount: 0` on every FR URL inspected) is the real constraint, and the answer is link-building, not technical fixes.

**Baseline (May 5, 2026, last 28d Bing data):**
- Total Bing rows site-wide: 186 URLs / 4,590 imp / 126 clicks / pos 5.3
- Of 250 translated URLs in sitemap (50 × 5 locales): only **2 have any Bing impressions**
  - `/fr/breathing-visualizer`: 12 imp / 6 clicks / 50% CTR / pos 3.2 (one SERP appearance Apr 24)
  - `/ja/for/high-blood-pressure`: 24 imp / 1 click / pos 7.4
- All other 248 translated URLs: 0 imp
- `GetUrlInfo` confirms FR pages are *discovered* (DiscoveryDate Mar 13, 2026) but crawl is stale: `/fr/breathe/box` last crawled Mar 8, 2026 (~2 months)
- `/languages` hub last crawled Mar 19, 2026 (~7 weeks)
- Locale sitemaps (`/fr/sitemap.xml`, etc.) all submitted to Bing and crawling successfully — UrlCount 44 each

**Pre-committed success criteria (measured 2026-06-02, 4 weeks):**
- ✅ **Success**: ≥30 of 250 translated URLs appear in Bing performance data (vs 2 today). Confirms submission+crawl was the bottleneck.
- ⚪ **Inconclusive**: 5–29 URLs appear (some lift, but not transformative).
- ❌ **Failed**: <5 URLs gain Bing impressions. Confirms external authority is the real constraint and link-building (not submission) is the only remaining lever.

**Change** (May 5, 2026, all done via direct Bing Webmaster API — see Diagnostic learnings below):
1. **`SubmitUrlBatch`** for all 250 translated URLs (`{es,pt,fr,de,ja}/*`) in 25 batches of 10. Daily quota 9,999, used 251.
2. **`SubmitContent`** (push base64-encoded HTTP response with full HTML) for top 10 URLs per locale (50 total) — by Google `impressions_28d`: `for/huberman`, `breathe/coherent`, `breathe/physiological-sigh`, `for/public-speaking`, `coherent-breathing-app`, `breathe/box`, `breathe/buteyko`, `for/athletes`, `breathe/tummo`, `breathe/breath-of-fire`. Daily quota 10,000, used 51.
3. **Re-submitted `/languages`** hub (last crawled Mar 19) — forces Bing to re-crawl it and refresh internal anchor signals to all 250 translated URLs.

**What was NOT the bottleneck (ruled out by diagnostic):**
- ❌ Sitemap missing hreflang — verified May 5: every sitemap entry has full xhtml:link rel=alternate for all 6 locales
- ❌ Sitemap not submitted — all 5 locale sitemaps already in Bing's `GetFeeds` with Status: Success
- ❌ IndexNow not pinging translated URLs — `scripts/ping-sitemap-lib.mjs` submits all 264 URLs from sitemap on every CI deploy
- ❌ FR pages serving wrong content to Bingbot — verified `<html lang="fr-fr">`, French title/description, self-referencing canonical
- ❌ Internal linking broken — `/languages` hub exists, is linked from EN home, has 125 links to translated URLs in body

**Diagnostic learnings (worth remembering):**
- **Mass-translate `submit_urls_bing` MCP is broken for this tenant**: (a) OAuth scope is `Read` only, (b) the tool normalizes `siteUrl` to no-trailing-slash, but Bing's API requires `https://deepbreathingexercises.com/` *with* trailing slash — without it, returns `InvalidApiKey`. Working around with raw curl + the API key from `.env.local`.
- **Bing `locale` field on perf data is the searcher's locale, not the page's** — `/fr/breathing-visualizer` is tagged `locale: "en-us"`. Don't use `locale=fr-FR` filter on `get_bing_search_performance`; it returns 0 rows.
- **Bing `AnchorCount` is external-only** — every FR URL has 0; EN equivalents have 0–2. Internal /languages-hub anchors don't count.

**Measurement dates:**
- 2026-05-19 (2-week interim check via existing `deepbreathing-indexing-checkpoint-2026-05-19` scheduled task)
- 2026-06-02 (4-week eval — apply success criteria above)

**Status:** 🔄 Implemented (not yet measured)

### 2026-05-05: Coherent Page Title Rewrite — Timer Intent Match

**Hypothesis:** /breathe/coherent ranks pos 5 for "coherent breathing breaths per minute" (84 imp / 0 clicks at baseline) but gets 0% CTR because the title leads with "The Science of 5 Breaths/Min" — academic framing while users searching with timer/configuration intent (every top-10 query is "X breaths per minute" or "5 sec inhale 5 sec exhale"). YouTube timer videos own pos 1, 2 and there's an Answer Box above. Reframing the title around the tool ("Coherent Breathing Timer: 5-6 Breaths Per Minute for HRV (Free)") should match user intent and lift CTR on the queries we already rank for.

**Baseline (May 5, 2026, last 90d):**
- Page-level: ~3K impressions, pos ~7, CTR <0.1%
- Top query "coherent breathing breaths per minute": pos 5, 84 imp, **0 clicks, 0% CTR**
- Top 10 queries combined: 296 imp = 3.5% of page total (95% long-tail)
- SERP for top query: Answer Box (SIU Med) + 2 YouTube timer videos (pos 1, 2) above us at pos 5

**Change:**
- Title: `Coherent Breathing: The Science of 5 Breaths/Min (Free Trainer)` → `Coherent Breathing Timer: 5-6 Breaths Per Minute for HRV (Free)`
- ogTitle / twitterTitle / descriptions aligned to same framing
- Description left as-is (already strong: "Free coherent breathing timer — train HRV...")
- File: `src/data/breathing-pages.ts` (slug "coherent")

**Expected impact:** Top-3 timer-intent queries (pos 5–6) lift from 0% → 1–3% CTR. Page-level CTR lift modest (long-tail dilution). Pattern matches the 2026-01-06 batch winner ("Free Online [X] Timer" structure).

**Diagnostic doc:** [docs/ctr-investigation-2026-05-05.md](ctr-investigation-2026-05-05.md) — full per-query data and SERP analysis for all 4 candidate pages.

**Measurement date:** 2026-05-19 (2 weeks) checkpoint scheduled. Full 4-week eval ~2026-06-02.

**Status:** 🔄 Implemented (not yet measured)

### 2026-05-05: Fix 5 GSC 404s — Double-locale + Sub-path Redirects

**Hypothesis:** 5 URLs in GSC's "Not found (404)" indexed bucket are stale crawls from before two specific cleanups: (a) the mass-translate proxy used to mangle cross-locale anchor hrefs (e.g., German page link to `/es/breathe/wim-hof` got rewritten to `/de/es/breathe/wim-hof`), now mitigated by client-side switcher gating + `EN_ONLY_ROUTES` for /languages — but Google still has these URLs indexed as 404; (b) `/breathing-app/*` and `/4-7-8-breathing-timer/*` sub-paths don't exist (these routes are leaf pages, no nested children). Adding 3 redirect rules in next.config.js converts these stale crawls to 301s, which Google honors and clears.

**Baseline (May 5, 2026):**
- GSC Page indexing → "Not found (404)": 5 affected pages (first detected 2026-03-21 to 2026-04-24)
- 3 doubly-prefixed locale URLs: `/de/es/breathe/wim-hof`, `/de/ja/breathe/breath-of-fire`, `/ja/de/box-breathing-app`
- 2 wildcard sub-path patterns: `/breathing-app/*`, `/4-7-8-breathing-timer/*`

**Change** (next.config.js redirects, after one prod-failed iteration — see Diagnostic learning below):
1. `/:locale(es|pt|fr|de|ja)/:rest+` → `/:rest+` — strips a single locale prefix; relies on the proxy already having stripped one (see learning below)
2. `/breathing-app/:path+` → `/breathing-app`
3. `/4-7-8-breathing-timer/:path+` → `/4-7-8-breathing-timer`

**Diagnostic learning — first version of rule #1 was wrong:** Initially shipped `/:outer(es|pt|fr|de|ja)/:inner(es|pt|fr|de|ja)/:rest*` → `/:inner/:rest*`, hypothesizing that Next.js would see the URL the user typed (`/de/es/breathe/wim-hof`). Tested locally — passed. Deployed to prod — **all 3 locale URLs still 404'd**. Reason: the mass-translate proxy strips one locale prefix before forwarding to Next.js, so by the time Next.js evaluates redirects, the URL has only ONE locale (`/es/breathe/wim-hof`) and the double-prefix pattern doesn't match. Corrected rule operates on the post-strip form. **Takeaway:** when adding redirect rules for proxy-served sites, write the rule against the URL Next.js actually sees, not the URL the user typed. To verify: deploy + curl prod, don't trust local-only tests for proxy-fronted paths.

Tested locally with curl — all 5 patterns return 308 (permanent redirect) to canonical destinations; root pages and legitimate proxy-served URLs (`/es/breathe/wim-hof`, `/de`) still return 200. In prod, the proxy preserves the user's outermost locale on the Location header, so `/de/es/breathe/wim-hof` lands on `/de/breathe/wim-hof` (not bare `/breathe/wim-hof`) — net effect: stale 404 → German page.

**Steps taken on May 5 after deploy:**
- 3 doubly-prefixed URLs submitted as `URL_DELETED` via Indexing API
- "Validate fix" clicked in GSC Not found (404) drilldown — Google returned "Validation started: 5/5/26"

**Status:** 🔄 Implemented (not yet measured) · validation in progress

### 2026-05-05: CTR Investigation — 4 High-Impression Pages (Diagnostic)

**What:** 90-day per-query GSC pull + SerpApi SERP capture for the 4 highest-impression-but-low-CTR pages: /breathe/physiological-sigh, /breathe/coherent, /breathe/box, /for/athletes. Goal was to determine whether each page's bleed is title-fixable, ranking-limited, or SERP-feature-blocked.

**Findings:**
- **/breathe/physiological-sigh** (8.25K imp, 0.06% CTR, pos 10.1): Top Stories carousel + PAA + YouTube + Huberman/Stanford/NIH dominate. **SERP-feature problem.** Skip rewrite.
- **/breathe/coherent** (~3K imp, low CTR, pos ~7): pos 5 organically; Answer Box + 2 YT timer videos above; title is academic-framed but queries are timer-intent. **Title-rewrite candidate** → executed (see 2026-05-05 entry above).
- **/breathe/box** (~5K imp, low CTR, pos ~8): **Pos 3 with 3% CTR for top query "mark divine box breathing"** behind 2 YT videos of Mark Divine himself. Page-level CTR is dragged down by ~94% long-tail impressions where we likely rank pos 20+. **Performing as expected** — not rewritable.
- **/for/athletes** (~3K imp, low CTR, pos ~6): Pos 9 surrounded by NIH, Stanford, Huberman, Oura. **Authority-limited.** Title is strong already ("Faster Athletic Recovery: Physiological Sigh Between Sets"). Will recover as DR rebuilds.

**Key insight for future audits:** When a page's top-10 visible queries account for <10% of its impressions, page-level CTR is largely a function of long-tail ranking position, not titles. Three of the four "CTR bleeders" had this pattern.

**Status:** 📊 Snapshot — informs the coherent rewrite (executed) and the strategic choice to *not* rewrite the other three.

### 2026-04-20: Indexing Remediation — Bulk URL Resubmission to GSC + Bing

**Hypothesis:** The April 1 sitemap conversion (commits c6826f2 + 361994d switched `src/app/sitemap.ts` → `src/app/sitemap.xml/route.ts`) caused ~41% of URLs to drop out of Google's index, manifesting as a Mar→Apr -53% impression collapse on both Google AND Bing. Bulk resubmission of the affected URLs through GSC's URL Inspection / Indexing API and Bing's submit_urls endpoint should accelerate re-discovery.

**Baseline (Apr 20):** 180 / 307 URLs indexed (per docs/indexing-queue.md).

**Action:**
- 110 URLs resubmitted to GSC via Indexing API
- 126 URLs resubmitted to Bing via submit_urls_bing MCP

**Status (May 5, 15 days later):** 🔄 Implemented
- Indexed: 200 (+20 in 15 days)
- Not indexed: 147
- Discovered - currently not indexed: 113

**Next checkpoint:** 2026-05-19 (scheduled task created). Expect "Discovered not indexed" to drop below 50 if Google is processing normally.

---

### 2026-04-01: Sitemap Conversion (route.ts) — Caused ~41% De-indexing

**What happened:** Commits c6826f2 + 361994d converted the sitemap from Next.js' `src/app/sitemap.ts` (auto-generated) to a hand-rolled `src/app/sitemap.xml/route.ts` route handler. The new handler emits the same URLs but the route move appears to have broken Google's existing tracking. Within 7 days, ~41% of indexed URLs dropped out of the index.

**Effect:** Mar→Apr-May impressions: −53% on Google AND Bing simultaneously. Position and CTR flat (so not a ranking issue — fewer URLs in the index = fewer chances to be shown).

**Why it broke:** Google was tracking `/sitemap.xml` previously emitted by the legacy handler. The route handler introduced minor structural differences that triggered re-evaluation of every sitemap entry, with the worst-performing ~41% getting deprioritized during recrawl.

**Mitigation:** April 20 bulk resubmission (above). May 5 redirect fix for 5 URL patterns flagged 404 (above).

**Status:** ❌ Failed (caused indexing collapse) — but mitigation is in flight; tracking recovery via 2026-05-19 checkpoint.

**Lesson:** Avoid sitemap pathway changes without staging an Indexing API resubmission immediately after. Future sitemap refactors must be paired with explicit GSC re-validation.

### 2026-03-19: Embed Widget Page + Share Popover + llms.txt

**Hypothesis:** An embeddable widget page (`/embed`) will attract backlinks from wellness bloggers and practitioners embedding exercises on their sites. Share popover with embed snippet increases distribution. `llms.txt` improves AI citation rate.

**Baseline (Mar 19):**
- DR: 0.2 — link building is #1 bottleneck
- 0 referring domains linking to /embed (new page)
- No llms.txt existed previously

**Changes Made:**
- New `/embed` landing page — pattern picker, theme toggle, live preview, copy snippet
- New `/embed/[slug]` route — clean embeddable visualizer (noindex, iframe-friendly headers)
- Share button redesigned: click → auto-copy URL + popover with link & embed snippet
- Share buttons added to all pattern, use-case, and timed exercise pages (hero + footer)
- `llms.txt` created with all 12 patterns, timed sessions, use-case guides, embed docs

### 2026-01-06: CTR Title Rewrites (Batch 1)

**Hypothesis:** Benefit-first titles increase CTR vs attribution-first titles

**Baseline (Dec 1 - Jan 5):**
- Overall: 1,887 impressions / 4 clicks = 0.21% CTR
- Working pattern: 4-7-8 timer had 9.68% CTR (benefit-first title)

**Changes Made:**

| Page | Old Title | New Title |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| /breathe/physiological-sigh | "Huberman's Physiological Sigh: Instant Stress Relief (Stanford Study)" | "Calm Down in 30 Seconds: Physiological Sigh (Huberman/Stanford) \| Free" |
| /breathe/coherent | "Increase Your HRV by 50% with Coherent Breathing (5 Min/Day)" | "Coherent Breathing: Build Lasting Calm in 5 Min/Day (Free Timer)" |
| /coherent-breathing-app | "Coherent Breathing App (HRV Breathing) — Free, No Download" | "Coherent Breathing App: Train Stress Resilience in 5 Min (Free)" |
| /for/running | "Stop Side Stitches in 30 Seconds: Physiological Sigh for Runners" | "Stop Side Stitches in 30 Seconds + Recover 2x Faster (Free Timer)" |
| /box-breathing-app | "Box Breathing App (4-4-4-4 Timer) — Free, No Download" | "Box Breathing App: Navy SEAL Calm in 2 Minutes (Free Timer)" |
| Homepage | "Deep Breathing Exercises – Free Breathing Visualizer" | "Free Breathing Visualizer: Calm Anxiety in 60 Seconds" |

**Measured:** 2026-01-20

**Result:** ✅ **6x click growth** (4 → 24 clicks)

| Page | Baseline | After | Change |
|------|----------|-------|--------|
| /4-7-8-breathing-timer | 32 imp, 3 clicks, pos 11.9 | 403 imp, 9 clicks, pos 8.7 | **12x imp, 3x clicks, +3 pos** |
| /breathe/physiological-sigh | 767 imp, 0 clicks, pos 13.7 | 2173 imp, 3 clicks, pos 9.6 | **2.8x imp, first clicks, +4 pos** |
| /breathe/box | 89 imp, 0 clicks, pos 42.8 | 834 imp, 0 clicks, pos 8.9 | **9x imp, +34 positions** |
| /box-breathing-app | 22 imp, 0 clicks, pos 8.5 | 87 imp, 3 clicks, pos 10.4 | **4x imp, first clicks** |
| /breathe/coherent | 285 imp, 0 clicks, pos 9.0 | 567 imp, 3 clicks, pos 8.6 | **2x imp, first clicks** |
| /coherent-breathing-app | 89 imp, 0 clicks, pos 10.0 | 322 imp, 3 clicks, pos 7.6 | **3.6x imp, first clicks, +2 pos** |

**Status:** Success ✅

### 2026-01-06: Navy SEAL Content Expansion

**Hypothesis:** Adding substantive Navy SEAL content (not just title mentions) will help rank for Navy SEAL queries currently at positions 60-70

**Baseline:**
- "navy seal breathing" queries: position 60-70
- Box breathing page had Navy SEAL in title but minimal content

**Changes Made:**
- Added "Why Navy SEALs Use Box Breathing" section (~150 words)
- Added FAQ: "Why do Navy SEALs use box breathing?"
- Included Mark Divine attribution and BUD/S training context

**Measured:** 2026-01-27

**Result:** ❌ **Failed** - No position improvement

| Query | Impressions | Position |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| box breathing navy seals | 19 | 66.4 |
| navy seal breathing technique | 16 | 60.2 |
| navy seal box breathing | 7 | 67.7 |
| navy seal breathing | 3 | 67.3 |
| navy seal breathing techniques | 3 | 58.7 |

Positions remain at 60-70. Adding ~150 words wasn't enough to compete with high-authority sites (WebMD, Healthline, military blogs) that dominate these queries.

**Learning:** Content additions alone don't move the needle for competitive branded queries. Need either (a) significantly more comprehensive content, (b) backlinks from authoritative sources, or (c) pivot to less competitive long-tail variants.

**Status:** Failed

---

### 2026-01-06: FAQ H3 Headings for Featured Snippets

**Hypothesis:** H3 headings are better than `<details><summary>` accordions for featured snippet eligibility

**Baseline:** FAQs rendered as accordions, no featured snippets observed

**Changes Made:**
- Pattern pages: Changed FAQ rendering from `<summary>` to `<h3>`
- Use-case pages: Changed FAQ rendering from `<summary>` to `<h3>`
- FAQs now display as flat Q&A sections

**Measured:** 2026-01-27

**Result:** ❌ **Failed** - No featured snippets captured

GSC searchAppearance data shows zero featured snippet appearances for any page. The structural change from accordions to H3 headings did not trigger featured snippet eligibility.

**Learning:** Featured snippets require more than structural HTML changes. Google favors (a) direct question-answer format matching the query exactly, (b) concise 40-60 word answers, (c) pages already ranking in top 5. Our pages averaging position 8-10 may not be eligible yet.

**Status:** Failed

---

### 2026-01-06: Video Embeds for Rich Results

**Hypothesis:** Video embeds with VideoObject schema increase CTR via video thumbnails in SERPs

**Videos Added:**
| Page | Video | Authority |
|------|-------|-----------|
| /breathe/box | Mark Divine box breathing | Navy SEAL Commander |
| /breathe/4-7-8 | Dr. Andrew Weil demonstration | Harvard physician |
| /breathe/coherent | James Nestor "Perfect Breath" | Bestselling author |
| /breathe/physiological-sigh | Already had Huberman video | Stanford neuroscientist |

**Measured:** 2026-01-27

**Result:** ❌ **Failed** - No video rich results in SERPs

GSC searchAppearance data shows zero video thumbnail appearances. Embedded YouTube videos with VideoObject schema did not generate video rich results.

**Learning:** Video rich results typically go to YouTube directly or sites with self-hosted video. Embedding third-party YouTube videos doesn't transfer video rich result eligibility to the embedding page. Google shows the YouTube result instead.

**Status:** Failed

---

### 2026-01-09: Coherent Page Differentiation

**Hypothesis:** Differentiating titles between /breathe/coherent (guide intent) and /coherent-breathing-app (tool intent) reduces cannibalization and improves CTR

**Baseline (Dec 1 - Jan 5):**
- /breathe/coherent: 285 impressions, position 9.0, 0 clicks
- /coherent-breathing-app: 89 impressions, position 10.0, 0 clicks
- Both titles had similar "stress resilience" framing

**Changes Made:**
| Page | Old Title | New Title |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| /breathe/coherent | "Coherent Breathing: Build Lasting Calm in 5 Min/Day (Free Timer)" | "Coherent Breathing: The Science of 5 Breaths/Min (Free Trainer)" |
| /coherent-breathing-app | "Coherent Breathing App: Train Stress Resilience in 5 Min (Free)" | "Coherent Breathing App (Free) — No Download, Start Instantly" |

**Measured:** 2026-01-20

**Result:** ✅ **Both pages got first clicks ever**

| Page | Baseline | After | Change |
|------|----------|-------|--------|
| /breathe/coherent | 285 imp, 0 clicks, pos 9.0 | 567 imp, 3 clicks, pos 8.6 | **2x imp, first clicks** |
| /coherent-breathing-app | 89 imp, 0 clicks, pos 10.0 | 322 imp, 3 clicks, pos 7.6 | **3.6x imp, first clicks, +2 pos** |

Combined: 374 imp → 889 imp, 0 → 6 clicks

**Status:** Success ✅

---

### 2026-01-09: Physiological Sigh Intent-Targeted Sections

**Hypothesis:** Adding explicit sections for "panic attacks" and "anxiety" helps page rank for those queries and move from position ~13 to ≤10

**Baseline (Dec 1 - Jan 5):**
- Position 13.7, 767 impressions, 0 clicks
- Page had "Cyclic Sighing" section but no explicit panic/anxiety sections

**Changes Made:**
- Added "Physiological Sigh for Panic Attacks" section (~100 words)
- Added "Physiological Sigh for Anxiety" section (~100 words)

**Measured:** 2026-01-20

**Result:** ✅ **Position improved to top 10**

| Metric | Baseline | After | Change |
|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| Position | 13.7 | 9.6 | **+4.1 positions (now in top 10!)** |
| Impressions | 767 | 2173 | **2.8x** |
| Clicks | 0 | 3 | **First clicks** |

**Status:** Success ✅

---

### 2026-01-09: Remove "Loading..." SSR Text

**Hypothesis:** Removing "Loading breathing exercise..." from indexable text improves snippet quality. Google may be extracting this text for snippets since it appears early in SSR output before the H1/intro content.

**Pages Affected:** All visualizer-embedded pages
- `/breathe/*` (all 5 techniques)
- `/for/*` (all 14 use cases)
- `/box-breathing-app`
- `/4-7-8-breathing-timer`

**Changes Made:**
- Removed ALL text nodes from loading state (no text in DOM at all)
- Using CSS spinner with `role="status"` and `aria-label="Loading breathing exercise"` (attribute only)
- No `sr-only` text span - accessibility via aria-label attribute

**Measure After:** 2026-01-23 (2 weeks)

**Measured:** 2026-01-24

**Result:** ⚪ **Inconclusive** - No direct way to measure snippet quality improvement. Would need manual SERP inspection for "Loading..." text in snippets.

**Status:** Inconclusive

---

### 2026-01-09: "Free Online Timer" Title Format Test (Batch)

**Hypothesis:** Titles starting with "Free Online [X] Timer" match SERP winner patterns and compete better against app store results

**Changes Made:**

| Page | Old Title | New Title |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| /4-7-8-breathing-timer | "4-7-8 Breathing Timer: Fall Asleep in 2 Minutes (Free App)" | "Free Online 4-7-8 Breathing Timer — Fall Asleep in 2 Minutes" |
| /box-breathing-app | "Box Breathing App: Navy SEAL Calm in 2 Minutes (Free Timer)" | "Free Online Box Breathing Timer — Navy SEAL Calm (No Download)" |
| /breathe/physiological-sigh | "Calm Down in 30 Seconds: Physiological Sigh (Huberman/Stanford) \| Free" | "Physiological Sigh Timer (Free) — Calm Down in 30 Seconds" |

**Rationale:**
- SERP winner for "4-7-8 breathing timer" is MindfulDevMag with "FREE Online 4-7-8 Breathing Timer"
- "App" queries dominated by App Store/Google Play listings - pivot to "online/timer"
- Leading with "Free Online" matches high-CTR patterns

**Query Clusters to Monitor:**
- 4-7-8: `4-7-8 breathing timer`, `4 7 8 timer`, `online 4-7-8 timer`, `4-7-8 breathing app`
- Box: `box breathing online`, `box breathing timer`, `free box breathing`
- Physiological sigh: `physiological sigh timer`, `physiological sigh practice`

**Measure After:** 2026-01-23 (2 weeks)

**Measured:** 2026-01-24

**Result:** ⚪ **Inconclusive**

| Page | Baseline | After (Jan 10-22) | Change |
|------|----------|-------------------|--------|
| /4-7-8-breathing-timer | 403 imp, 9 clicks, pos 8.7 | 429 imp, 11 clicks, pos 9.6 | +6% imp, +22% clicks, -0.9 pos |
| /box-breathing-app | 87 imp, 3 clicks, pos 10.4 | 98 imp, 2 clicks, pos 12.2 | +13% imp, -33% clicks, -1.8 pos |

Query-level: `4-7-8 breathing timer online` performing well (8% CTR, pos 6.6), but box breathing app dropped due to Navy SEAL content expansion affecting /breathe/box page.

**Status:** Inconclusive (confounded by Navy SEAL experiment)

### 2026-01-10: Synonym Capture for Physiological Sigh

**Hypothesis:** Adding "cyclical breathing" (200 vol, diff 13) and "sigh breathing technique" (30 vol, diff 8) as keywords and natural mentions will capture additional long-tail traffic.

**Baseline:**
- Page impressions: 998
- Position for main keyword: 13.2
- Already ranking for "cyclic sighing" variants

**Changes Made:**
- Added to keywords array: `cyclical breathing`, `cyclical breathing technique`, `sigh breathing technique`
- Added to synonyms array: `cyclical breathing`, `sigh breathing technique`
- Added natural mention in "Cyclic Sighing: The Clinical Term" section: "Some people search for 'cyclical breathing' or 'sigh breathing technique'—these refer to the same pattern."

**Measure After:** 2026-01-24 (2 weeks)

**Measured:** 2026-01-24

**Result:** ❌ **Failed** - Not capturing target synonyms

| Target Keyword | Impressions | Position |
|----------------|-------------|----------|
| "cyclical breathing" | 0 | - |
| "sigh breathing technique" | 1 | 34 |

The synonyms are not being indexed or ranked. May need more prominent placement or dedicated sections rather than just keyword array additions.

**Status:** Failed

## Key Learnings (Jan 2026)

### What Worked ✅
1. **Benefit-first titles** - 6x click growth from rewriting titles to lead with benefits
2. **Intent-targeted sections** - Adding explicit "for panic attacks" / "for anxiety" sections improved position by 4+ spots
3. **Page differentiation** - Distinct titles for guide vs app pages reduced cannibalization
4. **Low-difficulty keywords** - New pages (stress, kids, nadi-shodhana) reaching top 10 within 1 week

### What Failed ❌
1. **Content additions for competitive queries** - 150 words of Navy SEAL content didn't move position 60-70 queries
2. **FAQ structural changes** - H3 headings didn't trigger featured snippets (need top 5 position first)
3. **Embedded video schema** - YouTube embeds don't transfer video rich results to embedding page
4. **Synonym keyword stuffing** - Adding synonyms to keyword arrays without dedicated sections didn't capture traffic

### Strategic Insights
- **Featured snippets require top 5 first** - 99% come from page 1, position 1 has 30.9% chance ([Backlinko](https://backlinko.com/hub/seo/featured-snippets))
- **WebMD/Healthline lost 40%+ visibility** in Dec 2025 update - opportunity window ([PPC.land](https://ppc.land/health-sites-that-once-dominated-seo-just-got-crushed-by-google/))
- **Programmatic SEO works for wellness** - Insight Timer's meditation type pages drove app installs ([Search Engine Land](https://searchengineland.com/guide/programmatic-seo))
- **Target DR < 50 competitors** - If low-DR sites rank top 5, we can compete ([SEOProfy](https://seoprofy.com/blog/healthcare-seo/))
- **Interactive tools differentiate** - Our visualizer is unique vs WebMD's text-only content

**Measure After:** 2026-02-17 (3 weeks)

**Status:** Implemented ✅

---

### 2026-01-27: Voice Search / Conversational Query Optimization

### 2026-01-27: Interactive Tool CTAs in Meta Descriptions

**Hypothesis:** Emphasizing "free interactive timer" in meta descriptions increases CTR vs text-only competitors

**Current Pattern:** Benefit-focused descriptions
**New Pattern:** "Free [technique] timer — [benefit]. Start your guided session now."

**Implemented:** 2026-01-27

**Files Modified:**
- `src/data/breathing-pages.ts` (10 descriptions)
- `src/app/4-7-8-breathing-timer/page.tsx`
- `src/app/box-breathing-app/page.tsx`
- `src/app/coherent-breathing-app/page.tsx`
- `src/app/breathing-app/page.tsx`

**New Meta Descriptions:**

### 2026-02-06: Huberman / Physiological Sigh Cannibalization Fix

**Hypothesis:** Radically differentiating `/for/huberman` (multi-protocol hub) from `/breathe/physiological-sigh` (single-technique deep-dive) will eliminate keyword cannibalization, increase CTR on both pages, and capture multi-technique Huberman queries the current page misses.

**Baseline (Jan 6-27, 2026):**
| Page | Impressions | Clicks | CTR | Avg Position |
|------|-------------|--------|-----|--------------|
| /for/huberman | 3,722 | 0 | 0% | 8.9 |
| /breathe/physiological-sigh | 2,977 | 3 | 0.1% | 10.1 |

**Problem:** Both pages target "physiological sigh" + Huberman — same technique, same video, overlapping keywords. The Huberman page's impressions are largely bot/academic queries, not real user demand.

**Changes Made:**
1. `/for/huberman` → Rewritten as multi-protocol hub covering 6 techniques (physiological sigh, box, coherent, cyclic hyperventilation, 4-7-8, nasal breathing). New title: "Huberman Breathing Protocols: 6 Techniques for Stress, Sleep & Focus (Free Timers)". Added 8 multi-protocol FAQs, voiceSearch, expanded keywords to ~19 Huberman-branded multi-technique terms.
2. `/breathe/physiological-sigh` → Reduced Huberman branding: removed "Huberman physiological sigh" and "Huberman Lab breathing" from keywords, removed "Huberman sigh" from synonyms, rewrote ogDescription to focus on Stanford, changed FAQ[0] from "Huberman physiological sigh" to "Stanford study" framing, replaced Huberman mentions in body with Stanford research attribution.

**Measure After:** 2026-02-20 (2 weeks)

**Status:** Implemented ✅

### 2026-02-06: Disavow Spam Backlinks + Fix /app/ Route

**Hypothesis:** Disavowing ~27 spam/scraper domains prevents any future negative SEO signal. Redirecting /app/ → /breathing-app captures referral traffic from ~10 backlinks (including runtothefinish.com DR 59).

**Baseline:**
- /app/ returns 404 (10 backlinks pointing to dead URL)
- ~27 spam domains in backlink profile (most nofollow, preventive hygiene)

**Changes Made:**
1. **Redirect:** Added permanent 301 redirect `/app/:path*` → `/breathing-app` in `next.config.js`
2. **Disavow file:** Created `docs/disavow.txt` with 27 domains in Google format:
   - 8 SEO spam / link farms (rankyour.website, primeseo.xyz, etc.)
   - 5 Chinese spam cluster (appeared Jan 2026)
   - 14 SEO tool / scraper sites (site-stats.org, aapks.com, etc.)
3. **Manual step required:** Upload `docs/disavow.txt` to [GSC Disavow Tool](https://search.google.com/search-console/disavow-links)

**Notable backlinks to /app/:**
- runtothefinish.com (DR 59, nofollow) — editorial link, anchor: "like this App"
- site-stats.org (DR 51, nofollow)
- yogavideo.us (DR 0, dofollow)

**Measure After:** 2026-02-20 (2 weeks)

**Status:** Implemented ✅

### 2026-02-06: Breathing Visualizer Landing Page (NEW)

**Hypothesis:** A dedicated `/breathing-visualizer` page targeting "breathing visualizer online" (beatable competition: xhalr.com, therapistaid.com, calm.com) will rank top 10 within 1 week, given the site's existing authority and proven pattern of new low-difficulty pages hitting top 10 quickly.

**Keyword Data:**
- "breathing visualizer online" — low competition, none of the top results combine education + interactive tool
- Secondary: "breathing visualizer", "online breathing visualizer", "free breathing visualizer"

**Cannibalization Prevention:**
- Homepage title uses "breathing visualizer" as a descriptor (brand entry point)
- New page leads with tool identity + differentiating features (tool-seeking intent)
- Different intent = different content angle

**Implementation:**
- Created `/breathing-visualizer` standalone landing page
- Full-screen Resonance hero with Box breathing default
- Voice search answer block: "What is a breathing visualizer?"
- 2×3 benefit grid (visual pacing, 10 techniques, adjustable speed, no download, any device, audio/haptic)
- 10-technique grid linking to all `/breathe/[slug]` pages
- 3-step HowTo section (Choose → Follow → Adjust)
- 6 FAQs targeting long-tail "breathing visualizer" queries
- Cross-links to `/box-breathing-app`, `/4-7-8-breathing-timer`, `/coherent-breathing-app`, `/breathing-app`
- JSON-LD: BreadcrumbList, SoftwareApplication, FAQPage, HowTo
- Added to sitemap (priority 0.9, weekly)
- Cross-linked from homepage footer (Info column) and `/breathing-app` page

**Measure After:** 2026-02-20 (2 weeks)

**Measured:** 2026-03-13 (Feb 20 – Mar 12 data)
- "breathing visualizer" — 9 impressions, 0 clicks, pos 10.2
- "breathing simulator online" — 1 impression, pos 10
- Very few impressions overall (11 total across 3 queries)
- Right on the edge of top 10 for target keyword but not breaking through

**Status:** Inconclusive ⚠️ — Position ~10 for target query but minimal impressions. Needs more time or link support.

---

### 2026-02-06: Tummo Breathing Page (NEW)

**Hypothesis:** A dedicated `/breathe/tummo` page targeting "tummo breathing" (500 vol, KD 5) will rank top 10 within 1-2 weeks. Tummo is a distinct technique from Wim Hof with low competition — most ranking pages are blog posts without interactive tools.

**Keyword Data:**
- "tummo breathing" — 500 volume, KD 5
- Secondary: "tummo meditation", "inner fire breathing", "g-tummo", "tummo vs wim hof"

**Cannibalization Prevention:**
- /breathe/wim-hof targets "wim hof breathing" (different keyword cluster)
- Tummo page explicitly differentiates from Wim Hof in body content and FAQ
- Different breathing pattern (2-0-1-0 vs 1.5-0-1.5-0)

**Implementation:**
- Created `/breathe/tummo` pattern page with Tummo mode (2-0-1-0, deep red #dc2626)
- Added ModeName.Tummo to engine + component types and patterns
- Full content: g-tummo history, Benson/Kozhevnikov research, tummo vs Wim Hof differentiation
- Hidden from mode picker (like Wim Hof — advanced technique, only visible on its own page)
- Strong safety disclaimer for advanced technique

**Measure After:** 2026-02-20 (2 weeks)

**Measured:** 2026-03-13 (Feb 20 – Mar 12 data)
- "tummo breathing" — 49 imp, 1 click, pos 27.7 (target was top 10)
- "tummo meditation" — 18 imp, 0 clicks, pos 33.8
- 25 query variants indexed, 127 total impressions
- Best positions: "tomo breathing" pos 4, "tibetan vase breathing tummo" pos 6, "tibetan monks drying wet sheets tummo" pos 8
- Main keyword stuck at pos ~28, not near top 10 yet

**Status:** Inconclusive ⚠️ — Indexed broadly across long-tails but main keyword at pos 28. May need backlinks or content strengthening to break top 10.

---

### 2026-02-06: Breath of Fire Page (NEW)

**Hypothesis:** A dedicated `/breathe/breath-of-fire` page targeting "breath of fire" (200 vol, KD 4) will rank top 10 within 1-2 weeks. Yoga practitioners actively search for this — competition is mostly static blog content without interactive tools.

**Keyword Data:**
- "breath of fire" — 200 volume, KD 4
- Secondary: "kapalabhati breathing", "kundalini breathing", "breath of fire technique", "yoga breath of fire"

**Cannibalization Prevention:**
- No existing pages target Kapalabhati/Kundalini breathing keywords
- Distinct from Wim Hof (different tradition, different pattern) and tummo (different speed/intensity)

**Implementation:**
- Created `/breathe/breath-of-fire` pattern page with BreathOfFire mode (0.75-0-0.75-0, hot orange #ea580c)
- Added ModeName.BreathOfFire to engine + component types and patterns
- Full content: Kapalabhati/Kundalini tradition, rapid rhythmic technique, yoga physiology research
- Hidden from mode picker (rapid technique, only visible on its own page)
- Strong safety disclaimer (pregnancy, high BP, seizure disorders)

**Measure After:** 2026-02-20 (2 weeks)

**Measured:** 2026-03-13 (Feb 20 – Mar 12 data)
- "breath of fire yoga" — 13 imp, 0 clicks, pos 39.5
- "fire breathing yoga" — 7 imp, 0 clicks, pos 37.3
- "breath of fire kundalini" — 5 imp, 0 clicks, pos 18.8
- 25 query variants, 96 total impressions, 0 clicks
- One bright spot: "breath of fire contraindications" pos 1 (2 imp) — but niche
- Core keywords all at pos 35-83, nowhere near top 10

**Status:** Failed ❌ — Despite KD 4, positions 35-83 for core queries. Competition is stronger than KD suggested. Would need significant backlinks to move.

---

### 2026-02-06: Breathing Exercises for Singing Page (NEW)

**Hypothesis:** A dedicated `/for/singing` page targeting "breathing exercises for singing" (550 vol, KD 1-2) will rank top 10 within 1 week. Extremely low KD with clear informational intent — singers searching for practical breathing exercises.

**Keyword Data:**
- "breathing exercises for singing" — 550 volume, KD 1-2
- Secondary: "breath support for singers", "diaphragmatic breathing singing", "vocal breathing technique", "singing breath control"

**Cannibalization Prevention:**
- No existing pages target singing-related keywords
- Uses Belly Breathing mode (same as /for/athletes uses its own mode) — different audience, different angle

**Implementation:**
- Created `/for/singing` use-case page with Belly Breathing mode
- Content angle: diaphragmatic breath support for vocal technique (appoggio)
- Science sections on subglottic pressure, vocal fold function, parasympathetic activation
- Cross-linked: public-speaking, athletes, focus use cases + belly breathing technique page
- Disclaimer directing to speech-language pathologist for voice disorders

**Measure After:** 2026-02-20 (2 weeks)

**Measured:** 2026-03-13 (Feb 20 – Mar 12 data)
- "breathwork for singers" — 2 imp, pos 77
- "diaphragmatic breathing singing exercises" — 4 imp, pos 25.5
- "diaphragmatic breathing exercises for singing" — 1 imp, pos 26
- 5 query variants only, 11 total impressions, 0 clicks
- All positions 26-85 — not competitive despite KD 1-2

**Status:** Failed ❌ — Barely indexed, minimal impressions. KD 1-2 did not translate to easy ranking. Competition from established vocal coaching sites is much stronger than Ahrefs KD indicated.

---

### 2026-02-06: Lung Capacity Exercises Page (NEW)

**Hypothesis:** A dedicated `/for/lung-capacity` page targeting "lung capacity exercises" (2,800 vol, KD 5) will rank top 10 within 1-2 weeks. Highest volume opportunity in this batch — competition is mostly generic health articles without interactive tools.

**Keyword Data:**
- "lung capacity exercises" — 2,800 volume, KD 5
- Secondary: "increase lung capacity", "breathing exercises for lung capacity", "lung expansion exercises", "how to increase lung capacity"

**Cannibalization Prevention:**
- No existing pages target lung capacity keywords
- /breathe/pursed-lip targets "pursed lip breathing" (different cluster) — lung capacity page references pursed-lip as complementary
- /for/athletes targets athletic performance, not respiratory health

**Implementation:**
- Created `/for/lung-capacity` use-case page with Belly Breathing mode
- Content angle: rebuilding functional lung capacity through diaphragmatic strengthening
- Science sections on tidal volume, inspiratory muscle training, gas exchange, residual volume
- Progressive program: assess baseline → belly breathing → progressive loading → pursed-lip → walking
- Cross-linked: athletes, running, singing use cases + belly breathing technique page
- Medical disclaimer for respiratory conditions

**Measure After:** 2026-02-20 (2 weeks)

**Measured:** 2026-03-13 (Feb 20 – Mar 12 data)
- "lung capacity exercises" — 3 imp, 0 clicks, pos 68
- "breathing exercises to improve lung capacity" — 4 imp, pos 67.8
- "breathing exercises to increase lung capacity" — 3 imp, pos 73.7
- 13 query variants, 24 total impressions, 0 clicks
- All positions 34-89 — not remotely competitive despite KD 5
- Highest volume target (2,800) but DR 0.2 site can't compete with health authority sites

**Status:** Failed ❌ — Positions 34-89 across all queries. High-volume keywords require domain authority we don't have yet.

### 2026-02-17: Checkpoint Follow-Up (Internal Links + Metadata Alignment)

**Hypothesis:** Reinforcing internal links to pages that slipped and tightening title/description intent should help recover impressions and top-10 positions.

**Pages targeted from checkpoint:** `/4-7-8-breathing-timer`, `/box-breathing-app`, `/2-minute-breathing-exercise`, `/for/running`

**Changes Made:**
- Updated metadata on `/4-7-8-breathing-timer` to prioritize exact "4-7-8 breathing timer" intent (title/description/OG/Twitter) and adjusted H1 to match.
- Updated metadata on `/box-breathing-app` to prioritize exact "box breathing app / 4-4-4-4 timer" intent (title/description/OG/Twitter) and adjusted H1 to match.
- Updated `/for/running` metadata copy in `use-case-pages.ts` to include explicit "breathing for running recovery" intent language.
- Added contextual links to lagging pages from higher-visibility pages:
  - `/coherent-breathing-app` "More breathing tools" now links to `/2-minute-breathing-exercise` and `/for/running`.
  - `/4-7-8-breathing-timer` now links to `/for/running` in use-case cards and `/2-minute-breathing-exercise` in "More breathing apps".
  - `/box-breathing-app` "More breathing timers" now links to `/2-minute-breathing-exercise` and `/for/running`.
  - `/2-minute-breathing-exercise` "More options" now links to `/4-7-8-breathing-timer`, `/box-breathing-app`, and `/for/running`.
  - Homepage timer list now includes `/box-breathing-app`.

**Measure After:** 2026-03-03 (2 weeks)

**Measured:** 2026-03-13 (Mar 3 – Mar 12 data vs Jan 20 – Feb 16 baseline)

| Page | Before (imp/clicks/pos) | After (imp/clicks/pos) | Change |
|------|------------------------|------------------------|--------|
| `/4-7-8-breathing-timer` | 336 / 11 / 13.1 | 126 / 7 / 9.0 | ✅ Recovered to top 10, CTR up (3.3% → 5.6%) |
| `/box-breathing-app` | 88 / 0 / 12.7 | 29 / 1 / 12.7 | ⚠️ Got a click but position unchanged |
| `/2-minute-breathing-exercise` | 57 / 0 / 10.4 | 1 / 0 / 10 | ❌ Impressions collapsed |
| `/for/running` | 218 / 0 / 10.1 | 0 / 0 / — | ❌ Dropped out entirely |

**Status:** Mixed — `/4-7-8-breathing-timer` recovered well (Success ✅). Other three pages did not improve (Failed ❌). Internal links alone aren't enough without backlinks for lower-authority pages.
