    "intro": "Breathe ~5–6 times per minute with equal inhales and exhales (e.g., 5–6 seconds each). This pace often maximizes respiratory–cardiovascular coupling and baroreflex engagement, acutely boosting HRV. Keep breaths small and quiet; comfort beats depth. If dizzy or air‑hungry, make breaths smaller or pause."

      "heading": "What it is",
      "content": "Coherent (aka resonance‑frequency) breathing uses equal‑length inhales and exhales at ~0.1 Hz (about 5–6 breaths/min). At this rhythm, heart‑rate oscillations (RSA) and blood‑pressure oscillations synchronize through the baroreflex, often yielding the largest HRV amplitude. Most adults land between 4.5–6.5 breaths/min; 5:5 or 5.5:5.5 seconds is a practical start. Mechanics: nasal, quiet, low (belly leads), shoulders and jaw soft. Focus on smooth flow rather than big breaths."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Benefits",
      "content": "During practice, many people show increased vagally mediated HRV and baroreflex sensitivity, with lower heart rate and steadier blood pressure reactivity. Short, single sessions can improve state calm and stress reactivity; multi‑week practice can raise resting HRV and baroreflex gain in some populations. For mental‑health endpoints (stress, anxiety, mood), coherent breathing performs similarly to a well‑designed paced‑breathing placebo in a large randomized trial—expect small‑to‑moderate improvements with regular practice rather than dramatic changes. Net: reliable physiology, modest subjective benefits, excellent fit for pre‑focus or recovery blocks."
    },
    {
      "heading": "When to use",
      "content": "Before deep work or creative sessions (5–10 minutes). Between task blocks to reset attention (2–5 minutes). Pre‑performance to reduce jitters without sedation (2–3 minutes). As a daily nervous‑system practice (5–10 minutes). For sleep wind‑down, coherent breathing can help, but some prefer exhale‑emphasized patterns; choose comfort."
    },
    {
      "heading": "When to skip",
      "content": "If you feel dizzy, tingly, or air‑hungry, pause; resume with smaller, quieter breaths or shorter sessions. People with cardiopulmonary disease, uncontrolled hypertension, syncope history, or during pregnancy should avoid straining and may prefer shorter sessions and gentle pacing. If slow breathing triggers panic, use patterns without long holds (coherent uses no holds) or switch to a physiological sigh for rapid relief."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What makes coherent breathing different from other slow‑breathing patterns?",
      "answer": "Coherent breathing deliberately targets ~0.1 Hz, where heart‑rate and blood‑pressure oscillations resonate. This often yields the largest HRV amplitude and stronger baroreflex engagement than other rates. Reviews and lab studies show immediate increases in HRV and baroreflex markers at ~5–6 breaths/min. Individual optima vary (roughly 4.5–6.5 breaths/min), so slight adjustments (e.g., 5.0 vs 5.5 s) can matter. If you just want calm, any comfortable slow pace helps; for maximal HRV amplitude, coherent is a strong default."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does coherent breathing improve mental health outcomes?",
      "answer": "A large randomized, placebo‑controlled trial found coherent breathing (~5.5 breaths/min, ~10 min/day for 4 weeks) did not outperform a well‑designed paced‑breathing placebo (12 breaths/min) on mental‑health and wellbeing outcomes, though both groups improved from baseline. Meta‑analyses of HRV biofeedback and breathwork more broadly show small‑to‑moderate benefits on stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms with practice. Expect modest subjective gains; the physiological HRV boost is robust during sessions."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I find my best rate?",
      "answer": "Most people sit between 4.5–6.5 breaths/min. Start at 5:5 or 5.5:5.5 seconds. If it feels strained, drop to 5:5 or 4.5:4.5; if it feels too easy, try 6:6. In clinics, practitioners assess resonance by testing several rates while monitoring HRV and heart‑breath phase synchrony. Resonance can drift across days, so treat the number as a range, not a fixed target."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there a risk of over‑breathing or low CO₂?",
      "answer": "Yes—novices sometimes ventilate too much when breathing slowly. Signs: dizziness, tingling, chest tightness. Fixes: smaller, quieter breaths; keep jaw/shoulders relaxed; shorten sessions. Brief anti‑hyperventilation instructions or capnometry (if available) help maintain normal CO₂. If symptoms persist, switch to shorter sessions or another pattern."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long and how often should I practice?",
      "answer": "For performance/focus, 5 minutes pre‑task works well. For training effects (resting HRV, baroreflex markers), aim for 5–10 minutes most days for several weeks. Evidence suggests repeated practice outperforms occasional, very short sessions. Combine coherent breathing with good sleep, activity, and light exposure for best results."

If your product supports sensors, a simple “breaths/min + subjective ease (0–10) + optional HR” overlay is sufficient; phase‑sync and HR Max–Min require ECG/PPG and are clinic‑grade features.
