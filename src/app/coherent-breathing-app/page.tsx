          <div className="mt-4 space-y-4 text-muted-foreground">
            <p>
              Coherent breathing is a paced breathing technique where you breathe at approximately 5-6 breaths per minute with
              equal inhale and exhale durations. This specific breathing rate—around 10-12 seconds per breath cycle—aligns your
              breathing with your cardiovascular rhythms, creating a state of &ldquo;coherence&rdquo; in your autonomic nervous system.
            </p>
            <p>
              The technique was developed by researchers studying heart rate variability (HRV) and the resonance frequency of
              the cardiovascular system. When you breathe at your resonance frequency (which for most people falls between 4.5-6.5
              breaths per minute), your heart rate variability reaches its maximum amplitude. This creates optimal conditions for
              nervous system flexibility and resilience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike techniques with breath holds (like box breathing or 4-7-8), coherent breathing uses continuous, smooth
              breathing with no pauses. This makes it ideal for longer practice sessions of 10-20 minutes, which is where the
              most significant benefits emerge. The simplicity of the pattern—just equal in and out breathing—allows you to
              sustain the practice without strain or discomfort.
            </p>
            <p>
              Coherent breathing is also called &ldquo;resonant frequency breathing,&rdquo; &ldquo;HRV breathing,&rdquo; or &ldquo;0.1 Hz breathing&rdquo; (because
              6 breaths per minute equals a frequency of 0.1 Hz). It&apos;s widely used in biofeedback therapy, sports psychology, and
              stress management programs.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-card-foreground">How coherent breathing works</h2>
          <div className="mt-4 space-y-4 text-muted-foreground">
            <p>
              Coherent breathing works by synchronizing multiple physiological rhythms in your body—primarily your breathing,
              heart rate, and blood pressure. This synchronization occurs at what&apos;s called your &ldquo;resonance frequency,&rdquo; typically
              around 5-6 breaths per minute for most adults.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you breathe, your heart rate naturally speeds up slightly on the inhale and slows down on the exhale. This is
              called respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), and it&apos;s a sign of healthy autonomic function. At your resonance
              frequency, this heart rate oscillation reaches its maximum amplitude—your HRV is at its peak.
            </p>
            <p>
              This maximized HRV isn&apos;t just a number—it reflects optimal coordination between your sympathetic (activation) and
              parasympathetic (relaxation) nervous systems. Instead of one dominating the other or fighting for control, they
              work together in a balanced, flexible rhythm. Think of it like tuning an instrument: when you hit the right
              frequency, everything resonates together perfectly.
            </p>
            <p>
              The equal inhale and exhale pattern (unlike exhale-emphasis techniques like 4-7-8) creates a balanced stimulation
              of both branches of your autonomic nervous system. This balance is what trains nervous system flexibility over
              time. Research using HRV biofeedback has shown that regular practice at resonance frequency can literally rewire
              autonomic reflexes, making you more resilient to stress.
            </p>
            <p>
              The practice also stimulates your vagus nerve, the main nerve of the parasympathetic system, which runs from your
              brainstem through your chest and abdomen. A well-toned vagus nerve is associated with better emotional regulation,
              lower inflammation, improved digestion, and even better social connection.
            </p>
            <p>
              Perhaps most importantly, the training effect is cumulative. While a single session feels calming, the real magic
              happens with consistent daily practice. Studies show that 10-20 minutes daily for 4-8 weeks produces significant,
              measurable improvements in HRV and stress resilience that persist even when you&apos;re not actively practicing.

              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-card-foreground">What is coherent breathing?</h3>
              <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                Coherent breathing is a technique where you breathe at a specific pace—typically around 5-6 breaths per
                minute—with equal inhale and exhale durations. This rate, often called the resonance frequency, maximizes heart
                rate variability (HRV) and promotes optimal balance in the autonomic nervous system.

              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-card-foreground">What is HRV breathing?</h3>
              <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                HRV breathing refers to breathing techniques designed to increase heart rate variability—the variation in time
                between heartbeats. Higher HRV indicates a flexible, resilient nervous system and is associated with better
                stress resilience, cardiovascular health, and emotional regulation. Coherent breathing is one of the most
                effective HRV training methods.

              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-card-foreground">How often should I do coherent breathing?</h3>
              <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                For optimal results, practice coherent breathing for 10-20 minutes daily. Research suggests that consistent daily
                practice produces the best improvements in HRV, stress resilience, and overall autonomic function. Even 5 minutes
                daily is beneficial, and some people do multiple short sessions throughout the day.

              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-card-foreground">What&apos;s the best breathing rate for HRV?</h3>
              <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                Most people&apos;s resonance frequency falls between 4.5-6.5 breaths per minute, with 5.5 breaths per minute (about
                5.5 seconds in, 5.5 seconds out) being common. Your individual resonance frequency is where your HRV amplitude is
                highest. Start with 5-6 breaths per minute and adjust based on what feels sustainable.

                Is coherent breathing better than box breathing?
              </h3>
              <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                They serve different purposes. Coherent breathing is optimized for HRV training, nervous system flexibility, and
                sustained practice sessions. Box breathing is better for acute stress management and focus. Coherent breathing
                has no holds, making it easier to sustain for 10+ minutes, while box breathing is typically done for shorter
                periods.

              <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                Yes, regular coherent breathing practice improves your baseline stress resilience and emotional regulation over
                time. While it&apos;s not typically used for acute anxiety relief (4-7-8 or box breathing are better for that), daily
                coherent breathing training strengthens your autonomic nervous system&apos;s ability to handle stress.

              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-card-foreground">Is it &quot;coherent&quot; or &quot;coherence&quot; breathing?</h3>
              <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                Both terms refer to the same technique. &quot;Coherent breathing&quot; is the most common name, describing the coherent
                state you achieve. &quot;Coherence breathing&quot; or &quot;cardiac coherence breathing&quot; emphasizes the heart-brain coherence
                that results from the practice. You may also see it called &quot;resonant frequency breathing&quot; or &quot;HRV breathing.&quot;
                All describe the same 5-6 breaths per minute technique.
