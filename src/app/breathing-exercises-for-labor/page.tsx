            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-card-foreground">Why breathing matters during labor</h2>
            <div className="mt-4 space-y-4 text-muted-foreground">
              <p>
                During labor, your body is working incredibly hard. Contractions are intense, and your natural response
                might be to tense up, hold your breath, or breathe rapidly. But this actually makes labor harder—tension
                works against your body&apos;s natural processes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Slow, controlled breathing does the opposite. It <strong className="text-card-foreground">activates your
                parasympathetic nervous system</strong>, which relaxes your muscles, lowers stress hormones, and helps
                your body work with contractions rather than against them. The extended exhale is particularly important—it
                triggers your vagus nerve, promoting calm and reducing pain perception.
              </p>
              <p>
                Research shows that women who use breathing techniques during labor report lower pain scores, feel more
                in control, and often have shorter labors. Breathing also gives your mind something to focus on, which
                helps manage anxiety and stay present.
              </p>

                <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                  Use slow, relaxed breathing: inhale through your nose for 4 seconds, exhale through your mouth for 6-8 seconds.
                  Between contractions, breathe normally and rest. This stage can last hours—conserve your energy.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div className="rounded-2xl bg-muted/50 p-4">

                <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                  Continue slow breathing during contractions. As intensity increases, you may naturally want to vocalize
                  on the exhale (moaning or humming)—this is normal and helps. Keep your jaw relaxed and shoulders down.
                </p>

                <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                  This is the most intense phase but also the shortest. Focus on one breath at a time. Your partner or
                  doula can breathe with you to help you stay in rhythm. Short &ldquo;pant-pant-blow&rdquo; patterns may
                  help if you feel the urge to push before you&apos;re ready.

                <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                  Follow your midwife&apos;s or doctor&apos;s guidance. Many recommend exhaling while pushing rather than
                  holding your breath. Between pushes, take a few slow, deep breaths to recover.
