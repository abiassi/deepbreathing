              <p>
                Box breathing is a structured breathing technique that follows a simple four-step pattern: inhale, hold, exhale,
                hold. Each phase lasts the same number of counts, typically 4 seconds each, creating a balanced &ldquo;box&rdquo; or &ldquo;square&rdquo;
                shape when visualized.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also known as square breathing or four-square breathing, this method is widely used by Navy SEALs, emergency
                responders, and athletes to maintain composure under pressure. The technique gained mainstream attention because of
                its effectiveness in high-stress situations, but it&apos;s equally valuable for everyday stress management.
              </p>
              <p>
                The classic pattern is 4-4-4-4 (inhale 4 seconds, hold 4 seconds, exhale 4 seconds, hold 4 seconds), but you can
                adjust the counts to match your comfort level. Beginners often start with 3-3-3-3, while more experienced
                practitioners might extend to 5-5-5-5 or longer.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-card-foreground">How box breathing works</h2>
            <div className="mt-4 space-y-4 text-muted-foreground">
              <p>
                Box breathing works by engaging your autonomic nervous system—the unconscious system that controls functions like
                heart rate, digestion, and stress response. When you&apos;re anxious or stressed, your sympathetic nervous system
                (fight-or-flight) dominates. Box breathing activates the opposing parasympathetic nervous system (rest-and-digest).
              </p>
              <p>
                The breath holds are particularly important. When you hold your breath after inhaling, you increase oxygen
                saturation and allow your body to use oxygen more efficiently. The hold after exhaling triggers a mild buildup of
                CO₂, which actually helps calm your nervous system and improves oxygen delivery to tissues.
              </p>
              <p>
                Research has shown that slow, controlled breathing patterns like box breathing can reduce cortisol levels (the
                stress hormone), increase heart rate variability (a marker of nervous system flexibility), and improve prefrontal
                cortex function (the brain region responsible for decision-making and emotional control).
              </p>
              <p>
                The equal intervals create a sense of balance and predictability, which itself has a calming effect. Your brain
                likes patterns, and the regular 4-count rhythm gives it something stable to anchor to when everything else feels
                chaotic.

                <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                  Start with 2-3 minutes (about 6-9 breath cycles) and work up to 5-10 minutes as you get comfortable. For acute
                  stress relief, even 1 minute can help. Daily practice of 5 minutes or more may provide the best long-term
                  benefits.

                <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                  Yes, box breathing is beginner-friendly. If the 4-4-4-4 pattern feels challenging, start with 3-3-3-3 or even
                  remove the holds entirely. The key is comfort—you should never feel breathless or strained.

                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-card-foreground">Is box breathing the same as tactical breathing?</h3>
                <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                  Yes, tactical breathing and box breathing refer to the same technique. It&apos;s called tactical breathing when used
                  by military personnel, law enforcement, and first responders to maintain calm and focus in high-stress
                  situations.

                  Should I do box breathing in the morning or evening?
                </h3>
                <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                  Box breathing works well at any time. Use it in the morning to start your day focused, before important meetings
                  or events, during stressful moments, or in the evening to decompress. Many people find it helpful right before
                  bed, though some prefer techniques with longer exhales for sleep.
